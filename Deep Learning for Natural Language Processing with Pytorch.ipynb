    "This tutorial will walk you through the key ideas of deep learning programming using Pytorch.\n",
    "Many of the concepts (such as the computation graph abstraction and autograd) are not unique to Pytorch and are relevant to any deep learning tool kit out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am writing this tutorial to focus specifically on NLP for people who have never written code in any deep learning framework (e.g, TensorFlow, Theano, Keras, Dynet).  It assumes working knowledge of core NLP problems: part-of-speech tagging, language modeling, etc.  It also assumes familiarity with neural networks at the level of an intro AI class (such as one from the Russel and Norvig book).  Usually, these courses cover the basic backpropogation algorithm on feed-forward neural networks, and make the point that they are chains of compositions of linearities and non-linearities.  This tutorial aims to get you started writing deep learning code, given you have this prerequisite knowledge."

Torch provies many in the torch.optim package, and they are all completely transparent.  Using the simplest gradient update is the same as the more complicated algorithms.

So why not just let the word embeddings be parameters in our model, and then be updated during training?  This is exactly what we will do.  We will have some *latent lexical attributes* that the network can, in principle, learn.  Note that the word embeddings will probably not be interpretable.

If you see an example in Dynet, it will probably help you implement it in Pytorch).  The opposite is the *static* tool kit, which includes Theano, Keras, TensorFlow, etc.\n",
    "The core difference is the following:\n",
    "* In a static toolkit, you define a computation graph once, compile it, and then stream instances to it.\n",
    "* In a dynamic toolkit, you define a computation graph *for each instance*.  It is never compiled and is executed on-the-fly\n",

    "* We build the tree bottom up\n",
    "* Tag the root nodes (the words of the sentence)\n",

    "\n",
    "However, another sentence might be \"Somewhere, the big fat cat scratched the wall\".  In this sentence, we will want to form the constituent $(2, 4, NP)$ at some point.\n",
    "The constituents we will want to form will depend on the instance.  If we just compile the computation graph once, as in a static toolkit, it will be exceptionally difficult or impossible to program this logic.  In a dynamic toolkit though, there isn't just 1 pre-defined computation graph.  There can be a new computation graph for each instance, so this problem goes away.\n",
